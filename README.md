- I am creating an App Budget Tracker to allow for offline access and functionality.

- You will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

- You will be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
  so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

This will allow users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
